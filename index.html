            <p>In Kathmandu, Nepal, Sanil often found himself lost in thought, wondering if his efforts would ever lead him anywhere. Years of rejections from colleges had left scars on his confidence, and now, with his final chance to apply, the weight of uncertainty pressed heavily on him. At night, his mind raced with questions: "Do I belong anywhere? Is there a place for me?"</p>

        <div id="part-2" class="story-part">
            <p>One such restless night, as silence enveloped his room, a soft glow emerged—gentle yet radiant. It wasn’t harsh or startling but soothing, as if wrapping him in calm. From within the glow stood an angel, serene and comforting, its presence filling the room with warmth. Sanil sat up, wide-eyed, unsure if he was dreaming or awake.</p>

            <p>"Sanil," the angel spoke, its voice calm and steady, "you’ve carried this burden for so long. You’ve worked tirelessly, but doubt clouds your heart. You wonder if there’s a place for you in this world." The angel paused, its gaze soft yet firm. "Let me tell you this: the place you seek is already waiting for you."</p>

        <div id="part-4" class="story-part">
            <p>"But how do I find it?" Sanil asked, his voice trembling. "Every effort I’ve made has led to closed doors. I feel like I’m chasing something that doesn’t exist."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-5" class="story-part">
            <p>"You’re closer than you think," the angel replied. "The place where you belong isn’t something I can show you—it’s something you will see for yourself. Close your eyes, Sanil. Imagine not the fear of failure, but the joy of where you truly want to be. Let your heart guide you."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-6" class="story-part">
            <p>Sanil hesitated but did as the angel said. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. At first, there was only darkness, but then, faintly, something began to emerge. He couldn’t explain it—it wasn’t a vision or a dream, but a feeling taking form. He saw a place that felt warm and inviting, where the air was filled with possibility and belonging. It was more than just a place; it was the answer to the question that had haunted him for so long.</p>

            <p>His lips curled into a soft smile as the image grew clearer in his mind. He didn’t fully understand it yet, but he believed. Somewhere, that place was waiting for him—a place that would welcome him, where all the struggles would make sense. It wasn’t just a dream. It was real, and it was out there.</p>
