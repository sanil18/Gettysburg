            <p>Sanil sat in his small room in Kathmandu, staring at the ceiling. Years of college rejections had left him feeling lost. This was his last chance. If he failed now, there was no next time. "Do I even belong anywhere?" he whispered into the night.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-2" class="story-part">
            <p>As he lay awake, a soft glow filled the room. It wasn't harsh or blinding—it was warm, like a gentle embrace. From the light, an angel appeared, calm and kind. Sanil’s heart pounded. Was he dreaming?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-3" class="story-part">
            <p>"Sanil," the angel said, its voice steady. "You’ve worked hard, but fear clouds your heart. You wonder if there’s a place for you." It paused, then smiled. "There is. And it's waiting for you."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-4" class="story-part">
            <p>"But how do I find it?" Sanil’s voice cracked. "I’ve tried so hard, and every door has shut on me. I feel like I’m chasing something that isn’t real."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-5" class="story-part">
            <p>"You’re closer than you think," the angel said. "But I can’t show you. You have to see it yourself. Close your eyes. Don’t think of failure. Just imagine where you truly want to be."</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-6" class="story-part">
            <p>Sanil hesitated, then closed his eyes. At first, there was only darkness. Then, slowly, something stirred. A feeling. A place. It felt warm, safe—like he belonged. He couldn’t explain it, but he knew it was real.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="part-7" class="story-part">
            <p>His lips curled into a smile. He still didn’t know how to get there, but for the first time in years, he believed. The place he longed for existed. It was out there, waiting for him.</p>
